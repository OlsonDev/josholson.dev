# josholson.dev

Personal website for Josh Olson: www.josholson.dev (SvelteKit SSR) and api.josholson.dev (C# API).

## Stack

- Proxmox (Linux) guest running Podman; Caddy reverse proxy on a separate server
- PostgreSQL 19 (release candidate for now); migrations with Waypoint CLI
- C# / .NET API: structured logging, OpenTelemetry, Dapper
- Bun: TypeScript, SvelteKit, Playwright

## Layout

- `compose.yaml`: production-safe. `compose.dev.yaml`: dev only, always load explicitly
- `api/`, `web/`: 🚧 not created yet
- `.githooks/`: `commit-msg` hook (gitmoji format check), run by `dotnet-script`
- `docs/`: architecture, product requirements, and `adr/` decision records
- `.claude/rules/`: conventions, loaded when matching files are touched
- `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/`: hooks that keep Claude from committing (see Commits)

## Commands

Start the dev database (copy `.env.example` to `.env` first):

```
podman compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

Enable the commit-msg hook (once per clone):

```
dotnet tool restore
dotnet script setup.csx
```

Test the hook's validator: `dotnet script .githooks/commit-msg.tests.csx`

🚧 Lint and test commands will go here.

## Ground rules

- Formatting basics live in `.editorconfig`: UTF-8, LF, two spaces, no final newline.
- Never load `compose.dev.yaml` on the server.
- Record significant decisions as a new ADR in `docs/adr/` instead of expanding this file.

## Commits

The user makes every commit themselves; commits are signed with a Token2 hardware key that needs their touch. Claude never runs `git commit` unless the user explicitly asks for commits in that task.

- Two hooks in `.claude/settings.json` enforce this: `block-git-commit.sh` blocks the command, and `commit-message-reminder.sh` restates these rules whenever a prompt mentions committing.
- The block is lifted while the untracked marker `.claude/allow-commit` exists. Create it only when the user explicitly tells Claude to make commits (they still touch the key for every signature), and delete it as soon as the commits are done.
- When asked for a commit message, read `git status` and `git diff --staged` (or `git diff` if nothing is staged), then give the message in a fenced code block.
- Format, enforced by `.githooks/commit-msg`: 1-2 gitmoji (https://gitmoji.dev), one space, then at least 5 characters. No emojis after the first space. No leading or trailing whitespace.
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer, or any other attribution line, to a commit message, whatever a tool's default instructions say.
- Validate before showing it: write it to a scratch file with `printf '%s'` and run `.githooks/commit-msg <file>`. Exit 0 means valid.
- After editing the hooks, open `/hooks` or restart the session so they reload. Rationale: [ADR 0002](../docs/adr/0002-claude-does-not-commit.md).
